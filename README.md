# Start2Move

This is project was produced in 2019 by the Dui team as part of the INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE STUDIO PROJECT unit (FIT5120).

The target audience for this project is people in Victoria (Australia) who are planning to move into a regional area. The system will ask for a few input questions and based on the selection will provide some recommendations in what city is more suitable to move in.
